"""Strategy-level risk evaluation — pure functions, no I/O.

Three rule layers, evaluated in order on every tick after per-leg eval:

  1. Trail-SL-to-entry (cross-cutting hook fired from the leg loop) —
     when any leg's SL fires AND ``strategy.trail_sl_to_entry=true``, the
     remaining open legs' ``effective_sl`` jumps to their ``entry_avg``,
     ``state.trail_to_entry_active`` flips ``true``, and the Overall SL
     branch is disabled for the rest of the run.

  2. Lock-profit (Lock mode):
        arm at if_profit_reaches → static floor at lock_profit
        trigger when mtm_total ≤ floor

  3. Lock-profit (Lock + Trail mode):
        same arm rule, then floor = max(lock_profit, peak − trail_step)
        trigger when mtm_total ≤ floor

  4. Overall SL / Target (skipped when trail_to_entry_active):
        target hit:    mtm_total ≥ overall_target_mtm
        sl hit:        mtm_total ≤ −|overall_sl_mtm|

Semantics match ``docs/plan/strategy-module.md`` Section 9.
