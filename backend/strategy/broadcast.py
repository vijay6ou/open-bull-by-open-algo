"""Per-strategy WebSocket broadcaster.

The tick processor and the audit subscriber publish messages here; the
WS endpoint (``/ws/strategy/{id}``) reads from a per-client queue.

Why a custom registry instead of Redis pub/sub: Phase 6 is single-process.
A future multi-worker deployment will add a Redis pub/sub fan-out behind
the same API (each worker subscribes to the channel for its connected
clients), so the WS endpoint's interface stays unchanged.

Throttle: deltas are coalesced to at most ``DELTA_THROTTLE_MS`` per
strategy. Events (state transitions) are never throttled — operators
must see ``leg_sl_hit`` the moment it fires.
