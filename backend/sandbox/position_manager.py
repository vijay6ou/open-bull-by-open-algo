"""
Sandbox position book.

Positions are updated atomically on every fill (:func:`apply_fill`). We track
realized and unrealized PnL separately so the dashboard can show both; the
*running average* cost is used for BUY accumulation and FIFO-style offset on
SELL (same as most brokers report).

Margin lifecycle (matches openalgo's sandbox):

* New position / accumulation: the order's blocked margin transfers from
  ``SandboxOrder.margin_blocked`` into ``SandboxPosition.margin_blocked``.
  No fund movement — the cash is already locked, only its bookkeeping bucket
  changes.
* Reduce: ``offset_qty / abs(old_qty)`` of the position's margin is released
  back to *available* together with the realized PnL on the offset, in a
  single :func:`fund_manager.release_margin` call (atomic transaction).
* Full close: the entire position margin is released along with realized PnL.
* Reverse with leftover: offset portion releases pro-rata, the residual
  position picks up whatever margin the order was carrying for the excess
  (see ``place_order`` for the position-aware sizing).

The per-user lock is held by the caller (the execution engine) for the
duration of fill processing — see :mod:`backend.sandbox.execution_engine`.
