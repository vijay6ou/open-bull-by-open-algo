"""
End-of-day T+1 settlement for CNC positions.

Any CNC position with ``net_quantity > 0`` is moved into ``sandbox_holdings``
after the trading day closes. In real markets this takes T+1 to settle; in
the sandbox we do it in one step at EOD so the holdings page has something
to show on subsequent sessions.

Short CNC positions are ignored (you can't hold a negative equity position).

    T+1 semantics: only positions whose ``updated_at`` predates the
    current session are eligible. A buy placed today stays in the
    positions book for the rest of today — it will be settled on the
    *next* EOD pass after at least one session has elapsed. Without
    this filter a same-day buy at 10:00 would land in holdings at 23:55
    the same evening, which contradicts T+1 and creates a confusing
    "I just bought it but it's already in holdings" UX.

    Margin bookkeeping for the move follows openalgo:
    ``fund.used_margin`` decreases by the position's blocked margin, but
    ``available`` stays the same — the cash that backed the margin is now
    "in" the asset (visible as ``totalholdingvalue`` on the holdings book).
    Without this step the ``used_margin`` field would drift over time as
    settled positions vanished without releasing their margin lock.
